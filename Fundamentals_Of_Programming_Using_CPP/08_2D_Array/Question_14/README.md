# Uniformity Matrix

Uniformity matrix is a matrix in which all the elements in the matrix are either completely even or completely odd. Write a C++ program to find whether a given matrix is a uniformity matrix or not.

### INPUT FORMAT:

The input consists of (n * n + 1) integers. <br>
The first integer corresponds to the number of rows/columns in the matrix. <br>
The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix. <br>
The elements are read in row-wise order, the first row first, then second row and so on. <br>
Assume that the maximum value of n is 5.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print 'Yes' if it is a uniformity matrix. Print 'No' if it is not a uniformity matrix.
