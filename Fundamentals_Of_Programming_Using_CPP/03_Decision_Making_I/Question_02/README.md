Tyrion Lannister ,Chandler Bing and Sheldon Cooper went on a tour to Zanzibar with their friends. As a part of the tour, you went boating with them. For the boat to remain stable, the number of people on one boat is restricted based on the weight of the people. You find that the boatman who is sailing your boat is so much greedy of money.
