# Array range

Write a program to find the range of the elements in the array. Range of an array is the difference between the maximum and minimum element in an array.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array. <br>
The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array. <br>
Output consists of an integer which corresponds to the range of the array. <br>
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. <br>
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.

### Sample Input 1:

```
5
2
4
1
3
5
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array
Enter the elements in the array
The range of the array is 4
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
3
1
2
