Write a program to find the mean of the elements in an array.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array. <br>
The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array. <br>
Output consists of an integer value which corresponds to the mean of the array. <br>
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. <br>
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.
