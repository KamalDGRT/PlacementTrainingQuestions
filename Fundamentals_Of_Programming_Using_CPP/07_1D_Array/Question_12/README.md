# Array insertion

Arjuna and Karna were playing cards. Arjuna has 5 cards. Karna wants to insert a new card in between Arjuna's cards. Karna wants to find the position to insert the card. So help him to find the position to insert a certain card. If Karna inserts a card in a position other than the position of 5 cards, the game will be over. So play carefully. EXAMPLE: For example, consider an array having three elements in it initially and a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2 and a[2] = 3 and you want to insert a number 45 at location 1 i.e. a[0] = 45, so we have to move elements one step below after insertion a[1] = 1 , and a[2] = 2 and a[3] = 3.
