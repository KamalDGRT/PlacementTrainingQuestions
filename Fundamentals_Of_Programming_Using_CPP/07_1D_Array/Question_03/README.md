# Count distinct elements

Howard Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothrapalli were developing a plan to find the ideal woman for Sheldon Cooper. There were puzzles, translations and questions to check a person's intelligence. One such question was to come up with a C++ program to count the number of distinct elements in an array. Ramona Nowitzki is a postdoctoral researcher and former graduate student of Caltech who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and she wanted to impress Sheldon by writing a program to count the number of distinct elements in an array. Can you help Ramona?
