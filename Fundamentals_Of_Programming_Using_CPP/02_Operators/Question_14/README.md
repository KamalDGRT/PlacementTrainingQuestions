# 3 Idiots

Phoebe, Rachel, and Joey were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Monica Ma'am. Their gang was known as 3-idiots. Phoebe, Rachel, and Joey live in the same locality. A new student Chandler joins their class and he wanted to be friends with them. He asked Rachel about her house address. Rachel wanted to test Chandler's mathematical skills and hence she told that her house is at the midpoint of the line joining Pheobe's house and Joey's house. Chandler was puzzled. Can you help Chandler out? Given the coordinates of the 2 endpoints of a line (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), Write a C++ program to find the midpoint of the line.
