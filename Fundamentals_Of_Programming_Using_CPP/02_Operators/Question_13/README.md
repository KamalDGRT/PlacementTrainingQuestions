# Splitting into the teams

During the weekend, Ross Geller has decided to conduct some team games. He wants to split his friends in into equal sized teams. In some cases, there may be some friends who are left out from the teams and he wanted to use the left out friends to assist him in conducting the team games. For instance, if there are 50 friends and if they have to be divided into 7 equal sized teams, 7 will be there in each team and 1 friend will be left out. Ross asks your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?
