# Amoeba Multiplication

The Research team led by Bernadette Wolowitz at Cal-tech University has discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting this amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given, write a program to display the amoeba’s size. For Example, the size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,... will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.... respectively.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
