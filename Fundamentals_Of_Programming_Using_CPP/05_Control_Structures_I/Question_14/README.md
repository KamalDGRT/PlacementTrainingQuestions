# Special number

Wil Wheaton who has filled in the shoes of Professor Proton in the show Professor Proton Fun with Mathematics wanted the kids to learn about Special number.(A 2-digit number is said to be a special number if the sum of sum of its digits and the product of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 19 is a special number. The digits in 19 are 1 and 9. The sum of the digits is 10 and the product of the digits is 9. 10+9 = 19.) Can you help Wil to write a C++ program to find all special numbers between 2 limits m and n(both inclusive). Assume that m and n are 2-digit numbers.
