Birthday Challenge

Louis was celebrating his 10th birthday and his parents wished to 
make his birthday more special by throwing a surprise bash, inviting 
all their friends, relatives and neighbors. The little mathematics 
geek Louis has another surprise waiting for him when he had to cut his 
favorite Choco vanilla cake. The cake is a rectangular cake and it 
consists of m x n [1 <= m, n <= 1000] squares. His friends now 
called him out for a challenge.

The challenge is that, Louis has to break the cake up into 1 x 1 pieces 
[individual squares] and find what is the maximum number of times that 
he breaks the choco vanilla cake, or pieces thereof, in order to 
achieve this?

Note that he cannot stack pieces of the cake and break them, because 
the choco vanilla cake is thick. As an example, a 2x2 cake requires 
3 breaks. First he can break it in half, then break each of the halves 
in half. He cannot break it in half, stack the two 1x2 pieces, and then 
use only one more break to achieve this goal.

Input Format :
First line of the input consists of an integer, the dimensions 'm' of the 
choco vanilla cake.
Second line of the input consists of an integer, the dimensions 'n' of 
the choco vanilla cake.


Output Format :
Output the minimum number of times that he breaks the choco vanilla cake.
