# Converting a Sequence to Another

-   You are given two integer sequences **A** and **B**,
-   Your task is to make the sequence **A** exactly identical to **B**.
-   You can perform three operations on the sequence **A** :
    -   Insert an integer at some position
    -   Remove an integer from some position
    -   Modify an integer i.e. give a new value to an integer at some position
-   Every operation takes 1 unit of cost.

-   Your task is, given **A** and **B**, find the minimum cost to convert **A** to **B**.

### Input

-   First line contains the number of elements in **A**
-   Second line contains the elements of the array **A**
-   Third line contains the number of elements in **B**
-   Fourth line contains the elements of the array **B**

### Output

Print the minimum cost of converting **A** to **B**

#### Notes

-   Size of the sequences will not exceed 1000
-   All elements of the sequences fit in a 32-bit integer.
