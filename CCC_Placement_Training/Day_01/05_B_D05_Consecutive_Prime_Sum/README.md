# B D05 - Consecutive Prime Sum

Some prime numbers can be expressed as Sum of other consecutive
prime numbers.

For example:

```js
5 = 2 + 3
17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
```

Your task is to find out how many prime numbers which satisfy this
property are present in the range 3 to N subject to a constraint
that summation should always start with number 2.

Write code to find out number of prime numbers that satisfy
the above mentioned property in a given range.

### Input Format

Each test case contains a number N <= 1000000000

### Output Format

Print the total number of all such prime numbers which are less
than or equal to N.
